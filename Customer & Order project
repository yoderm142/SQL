***Project using three tables to obtain customer order information***

***How many orders were placed in January?***
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

***How many of those orders (in January) were for an iPhone?***
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product

WHERE LENGTH (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'

***Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.***
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb

***Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?***
SELECT Product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

***What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?***
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS total
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product; 

***Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?***
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS total

***How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?***
